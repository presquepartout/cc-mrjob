Question 3: How long did it take to run the process locally and using EMR?

Locally: output from time command:
real	2m31.224s
user	2m25.420s
sys	0m5.182s

EMR: output from time command: 
real	23m35.566s
user	0m2.144s
sys	0m0.198s

The local real time is much shorter, but much of the EMR 
time is spent provisioning. 

Questions 4 & 5: 
There are 2042 address tags in both the local output
and EMR output. In addition there are some other tags
that have the term "address and the counts are the same. 

"address"	2042
"addresses"	19
"addressother"	1
"ccbillingaddress"	1
"creditcardbillingaddress"	1
"emailaddressalternate"	1
"eoneaddress"	1
"otheraddresses"	31
